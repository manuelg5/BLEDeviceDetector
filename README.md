# BLEDeviceDetector
This project contains C++ firmware for flashing a Particle Boron development board to scan for BLE devices nearby. The firmware detects a specific Bluetooth device based on signal strength (RSSI) and name, then publishes real-time event data to the Particle Cloud.

ðŸ”§ Features:
- âœ… BLE Scanning â€“ Scans for nearby BLE devices, logs details, and filters based on device name & RSSI
- âœ… Particle Cloud Integration â€“ Publishes events when a device is detected
- âœ… Signal Strength Filtering â€“ Only detects devices within a specified RSSI threshold
- âœ… Advertising Data Extraction â€“ Retrieves UUIDs, Major/Minor values, and manufacturer data
- âœ… Automatic Scan Stop â€“ Stops scanning once the target device is found

ðŸ“‚ Technologies Used:
- C++ (Particle Boron firmware development)
- Particle Cloud API (Cloud event publishing)
- BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) (Device scanning & data extraction)
- Serial Communication (Logging data via Serial Monitor)
